# Nidana AI
A production-grade AI system for symptom-based disease inference using structured clinical knowledge and OpenAI API.

This project ingests user symptom descriptions, medical history and contextual data, and outputs a ranked set of possible diseases with confidence scores and explanations. 
It combines medical knowledge sources (textbooks, clinical guidelines), rule-based safety checks, and modern AI techniques to provide explainable and responsible diagnostic support.

This tool is designed to augment clinicians and healthcare providers — not replace them — by offering evidence-based insights into possible diagnoses.

Built with modular architecture, explainability, and safety best practices in mind.
